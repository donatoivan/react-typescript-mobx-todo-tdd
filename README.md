# React-typescript-mobx-todo-tdd

## A todo list app built with React, Typescript, Mobx and Styled Components using TDD.

This is a little ap that I used as a vehicle to find out about TS, Mobx and Styled Components. I had some experience in React hadn't really played with hooks and functional components (Both are heaps of fun btw). I also wanted to explore using TDD with React and a state mangement library. Thanksfully, the process was quite enjotable and therapeutic. Shoutout to Kent C. Dodds and React Testing Library for also providing an enjoyable expereince. The finished app is available at https://romantic-bohr-d5180e.netlify.app/
